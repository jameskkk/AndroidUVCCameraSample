## How to compile(not ready now)

Note: Just make sure that `local.properties` contains the paths for `sdk.dir` and `ndk.dir`. Or you can set them as enviroment variables of you shell. On some system, you may need add `JAVA_HOME` envairoment valiable that points to JDK directory.  

```
sdk.dir={path to Android SDK on your storage}
ndk.dir={path to Android SDK on your storage}
```
